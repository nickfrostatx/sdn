SDN Controller
CPE 465 (Advanced Computer Networks)
Nicholas Frost

Full project implemented, developed primarily against mininet

Notes:
- A good amount of event.c:listen_and_serve is straight from epoll(7)

client.c - Low-level I/O logic for reading and writing OFP packets to clients
event.c - epoll event loop, with a priority queue for time-scheduled events
graph.c - Graph data structure, with 
map.cpp - C bindings to C++'s std::map
mst.c - Code to build the minimum spanning tree
openflow.c - Main controller logic
sdn.cpp - main()
