SDN Controller
CPE 465 (Advanced Computer Networks)
Nicholas Frost

Full project implemented, developed primarily against mininet

Notes:
- A good amount of event.cpp:listen_and_serve is straight from epoll(7)

beacon.cpp - Switch-to-switch link discovery
client.cpp - Low-level I/O logic for reading and writing OFP packets to clients
event.cpp - epoll event loop, with a priority queue for time-scheduled events
graph.cpp - Graph data structure, with shortest path and MST algorithms
openflow.cpp - Main controller logic
sdn.cpp - main()
